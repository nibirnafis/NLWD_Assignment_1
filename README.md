1. What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?

-->
Both types and interfaces are used to define types in typscript. While they share some similarities, there are significant differences between them.

#Type:
It was declared using type keywords.

Can be used to define both primitive and non-primitive types.

Supports the expansion through the intersection (&).

The declaration does not support the merger.

#Interface:
The interface was declared using keywords.

Only non-primitive types (object) can be used to define.

The extended can be extended using the keywords.

The declaration supports the merger (useful to increase the existing interface).
