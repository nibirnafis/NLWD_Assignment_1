1. What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?

-->
Both types and interfaces are used to define types in typscript. While they share some similarities, there are significant differences between them.

Type:
1. It was declared using type keywords.

2. Can be used to define both primitive and non-primitive types.

3. Supports the expansion through the intersection (&).

4. The declaration does not support the merger.


Interface:
1. The interface was declared using keywords.

2. Only non-primitive types (object) can be used to define.

3. The extended can be extended using the keywords.

4. The declaration supports the merger (useful to increase the existing interface).
